All PyTorch tensors also have a device attribute that specifies the device where the tensor is stored -- either CPU, or CUDA (for NVIDA GPUs). A tensor on a CUDA device will automatically use that device to accelerate all of its operations.\n","\n","Just as with datatypes, we can use the .to() method to change the device of a tensor. We can also use the convenience methods .cuda() and .cpu() methods to move tensors between CPU and GPU."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"L4nzpZPNRkTs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1601490840135,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1376,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Du","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgApUAW3lhVVae6qSSMIJSNSsAiMa0QYpsgY1hJMw=s64","userId":"02062741448048281377"}},"outputId":"e8bc4c4f-9e07-471e-844f-87485482c7f8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":136}},"source":["# Construct a tensor on the CPU\n","x0 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=torch.float32)\n","print('x0 device:', x0.device)\n","\n","# Move it to the GPU using .to()\n","x1 = x0.to('cuda')\n","print('x1 device:', x1.device)\n","\n","# Move it to the GPU using .cuda()\n","x2 = x0.cuda()\n","print('x2 device:', x2.device)\n","\n","# Move it back to the CPU using .to()\n","x3 = x1.to('cpu')\n","print('x3 device:', x3.device)\n","\n","# Move it back to the CPU using .cpu()\n","x4 = x2.cpu()\n","print('x4 device:', x4.device)\n","\n","# We can construct tensors directly on the GPU as well\n","y = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=torch.float64, device='cuda')\n","print('y device / dtype:', y.device, y.dtype)\n","\n","# Calling x.to(y) where y is a tensor will return a copy of x with the same\n","# device and dtype as y\n","x5 = x0.to(y)\n","print('x5 device / dtype:', x5.device, x5.dtype)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["x0 device: cpu\n","x1 device: cuda:0\n","x2 device: cuda:0\n","x3 device: cpu\n","x4 device: cpu\n","y device / dtype: cuda:0 torch.float64\n","x5 device / dtype: cuda:0 torch.float64\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LwRYcw4dRu3s"},"source":["Performing large tensor operations on a GPU can be a lot faster than running the equivalent operation on CPU.\n","\n","Here we compare the speed of adding two tensors of shape (10000, 10000) on CPU and GPU:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iSmC6zrXRrcb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1601490842684,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3916,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Du","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgApUAW3lhVVae6qSSMIJSNSsAiMa0QYpsgY1hJMw=s64","userId":"02062741448048281377"}},"outputId":"268082c4-7f16-42af-cc71-4b3cc754beb8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85}},"source":["import time\n","\n","a_cpu = torch.randn(10000, 10000, dtype=torch.float32)\n","b_cpu = torch.randn(10000, 10000, dtype=torch.float32)\n","\n","a_gpu = a_cpu.cuda()\n","b_gpu = b_cpu.cuda()\n","torch.cuda.synchronize()\n","\n","t0 = time.time()\n","c_cpu = a_cpu + b_cpu\n","t1 = time.time()\n","c_gpu = a_gpu + b_gpu\n","torch.cuda.synchronize()\n","t2 = time.time()\n","\n","# Check that they computed the same thing\n","diff = (c_gpu.cpu() - c_cpu).abs().max().item()\n","print('Max difference between c_gpu and c_cpu:', diff)\n","\n","cpu_time = 1000.0 * (t1 - t0)\n","gpu_time = 1000.0 * (t2 - t1)\n","print('CPU time: %.2f ms' % cpu_time)\n","print('GPU time: %.2f ms' % gpu_time)\n","print('GPU speedup: %.2f x' % (cpu_time / gpu_time))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Max difference between c_gpu and c_cpu: 0.0\n","CPU time: 135.46 ms\n","GPU time: 4.94 ms\n","GPU speedup: 27.41 x\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
